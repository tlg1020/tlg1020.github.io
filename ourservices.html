        Upgraded Services
    </p>
    <p>The following are add-on services. Their prices will be added onto any bath, clean-up, or full-service groom package.</p>
    <h3>Nail Grinding:</h3>
    <p>A dremel tool is used to safely shorten the nails further while also smoothing out the edges. Perfect for preventing your dog from scratching yourself, kids, or hardwood floors! ($15)</p>
    <h3>Teethbrushing:</h3>
    <p>We brush your pup's teeth with enzymatic toothpaste, and give them a spritz of breath spray too! Brushing your pet's teeth regularly will help reduce buildup of mild plaque and tartar. ($10)</p>
    <h3>Anal Gland Expression:</h3>
    <p>For the most part, dogs are able to express their anal glands on their own when having a bowel movement. However, some dogs naturally have a harder time doing so, especially smaller breeds. When this occurs, their dog groomer or veterinarian can express them manually to prevent infection or abscess. ($15)
    <h3>De-Shed Treatment:</h3>
    <p>Our de-shed shampoo and conditioner helps release loose undercoat, and is an essential upgrade during the shedding seasons, or for heavy shedders. While our treatment reduces shedding drastically, it does not completely eliminate it, so regular shedding treatments are recommended to keep the shedding to as little as possible. ($ by Size)</p>
    <h3>Color Treatment:</h3>
    <p>Our color treatment is for those looking to add something unique to their pup's grooming experience. We use a pet-safe dye and get creative. We can do a design requested by the owner (e.g., pink tail) or you can ask for a groomer surprise! Our pet-safe dye typically lasts until the pet's next bath. ($ by Size)</p>
