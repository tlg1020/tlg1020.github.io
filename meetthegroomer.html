    <h3>Trisha Gaulin</h3>

    <p>Hi there! My name is Trisha, and I am the groomer of Paws N' Go Mobile Dog Grooming. I have always had a love for animals ever since I was a little girl, and that love has now spread into my career. I have been working in the grooming industry for several years now, and am excited to bring my grooming salon right to your home! A little more about myself... I have two dogs of my own, Harley the Pug and Apache the XL American Bully (you may have scrolled by their handsome faces already at the top of my web page!). Harley is 10 years old, and is my baby. He has lost some use of his back legs, so on his rough days you may see him rolling around in his wheelchair. You may also see him riding shotgun in my bus occasionally! As for Apache, he is only 8 months old, and his heart is as big as his head! I love both of my boys, and care for my clients as if they were my own too.</p>
    <p>Safety and comfort are my top priorities as a groomer. My goal is to ensure your pet comes to love the grooming process, and leaves smelling and feeling good.</p>
